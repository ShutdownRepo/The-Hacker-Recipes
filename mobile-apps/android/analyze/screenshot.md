# Find sensitive data on screenshots
## Theory
When applications are run in the background, an automatic screenshot is generated. In case the application manages sensitive data, these captures can reveal information.

## Practical
1. Open your app, connect to your account, access sensitive information
2. Put the application in the background
3. Take a screenshot
4. Check that the screenshot is displayed correctly
